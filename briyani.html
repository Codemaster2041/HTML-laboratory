<li>Wash 2 cups of basmati rice in water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes.</li>

<li>Add 2 tablespoons of ginger garlic paste, 1 teaspoon of garam masala, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1/2 teaspoon of cumin powder, 1/2 teaspoon of coriander powder, and salt to taste. Mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
